# Why

Investigate the motivation and intent behind code. `tstack:how` answers what the code does and how it works. `why` answers what forces led to its shape.

## Posture

Work as a careful, cautious, and precise investigator. Be honest about what you know versus what you infer. [EPISTEMICS.md](EPISTEMICS.md) holds the confidence tiers and the phrasing guide: read it before you write the answer. The user's guess is a prompt for investigation, not a conclusion to validate.

## 1. Target and question

The **target** is usually a chunk of code, a pattern, a feature, or a named design decision. The **question** is usually a design rationale, a tradeoff, a motivating edge case, an external constraint, dead code, or a broad history sweep.

If the target is vague ("why do we do it this way?" with no clear referent), make your best guess from context: open files, recent edits, what was just discussed. State your interpretation in one line so the user can redirect, then proceed.

## 2. Code anchor (always)

Anchor the investigation in concrete code. Collect:

- the file paths and line ranges
- the key symbols (functions, classes, constants)
- the last commits touching the target
- PR numbers from merge commits (`(#1234)` in the subject line)
- ticket IDs from commit messages and PR bodies

```bash
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>        # last-touch commits for the target lines
git log --follow -p -- <file>            # full history with patches, through renames
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>          # recent commits, PR numbers visible
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>          # full message: PR number, ticket IDs
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
```

Pull the PR body, comments, and reviews for every substantive commit: review threads are where the real signal usually is. Skip bot commits (Dependabot, Renovate, automated backports); they carry no motivation. When the anchor links one specific ticket, doc, or thread and an available MCP server can read it, read that item. Following a link is part of the anchor. Searching is the sweep.

## 3. Choose the depth

- **Quick (default).** Synthesize from the anchor. Go to step 5.
- **Deep.** Run the sweep in step 4 only when the user asks for it (`deep`, or "dig deeper"). It spawns several investigators and reads connected tools, so never start it on your own.

When the quick answer is inconclusive, say so and offer `deep`, naming the sources it would read. Inconclusive means:
  - no claim reaches Direct or Supported for the question asked;
  - the anchor points at a ticket, doc, thread, incident, or error you could not read; or
  - the code looks defensive (null checks, retries, timeouts, rate limits, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handlers) and nothing in the anchor names what it defends against.

Say in one line of the answer which depth you ran and why.

## 4. Deep sweep

### Discover the sources

MCP servers appear as tools named `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, including deferred tools that are listed by name only. Map each server to one evidence category, using its name, its tool names, and its server instructions. When a server fits two categories, choose the one matching its primary evidence and record the ambiguity in the coverage map.

| Category | Playbook | Servers it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Source control history | [code-archaeology.md](sources/code-archaeology.md) | git and `gh`, always available |
| Issue / ticket tracker | [linear.md](sources/linear.md) | Linear; adapt for Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut |
| Long-form documents | [notion.md](sources/notion.md) | Notion; adapt for Confluence, Google Docs, Coda |
| Real-time team chat | [slack.md](sources/slack.md) | Slack; adapt for Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost |
| Infrastructure observability | [datadog.md](sources/datadog.md) | Datadog; adapt for New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk |
| Error / exception tracking | [sentry.md](sources/sentry.md) | Sentry; adapt for Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake |
| Product analytics warehouse | [databricks.md](sources/databricks.md) | Databricks SQL; adapt for Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt |

Playbooks name tools without the `mcp__<server>__` prefix. Aim for a complete coverage map, not a minimal one. Document the null, don't skip the search.

### Spawn the investigators

Spawn one investigator per category that has a matching server, and always one for source control. Launch them all in one message so they run concurrently. Each owns exactly one source; never ask one agent to cover two.

- Use `subagent_type: general-purpose` with `model: sonnet`. It inherits the session's MCP tools and reads whole threads and documents; the `Explore` agent reads excerpts and is built for locating code, not for open-ended searching and quoting.
- The prompt is everything below the divider in [INVESTIGATOR.md](INVESTIGATOR.md) with its placeholders filled in, plus the category's playbook, plus the code anchor and the user's question verbatim.
- Add [incident-postmortem.md](sources/incident-postmortem.md) to every brief when the target code looks defensive.
- The brief forbids writes. Investigators search and read; they never edit files, commit, comment, post, or change a ticket.

What each category surfaces best. Use it to know what to expect back, and to name the gap when a category returns empty:

1. **Source control.** Implementation-time rationale captured during review. The only guaranteed source.
2. **Tracker.** The product or business forcing function. Strongest when the why is external to engineering.
3. **Long-form documents.** Design rationale written out before it became code.
4. **Chat.** Real-time deliberation that never reached a doc. Most important when the source control, ticket, and doc trail is thin.
5. **Infrastructure observability.** The runtime reality that motivated the code. Strongest when the target reacts to an infra signal (timeouts, retries, rate limits, circuit breakers).
6. **Error tracking.** The exceptions and error trajectories behind defensive or corrective code (catch blocks, null guards, type checks, retries).
7. **Analytics warehouse.** The product and data reality: flag-gated code, experiment-driven ships, data migrations, "where did this number come from".

### Skip only with a written reason

Every skip goes in Sources consulted with its reason. Two reasons are valid:

- **No server is available** for that category. This is a gap, not a choice: "Real-time team chat: not searched. No matching MCP server, so the conversational record was not searchable."
- **The source is provably irrelevant**, not "probably irrelevant". The bar is high: "Error / exception tracking: skipped. The target is a build-time script with no runtime code path."

## 5. Synthesize

Write the answer yourself with [SYNTHESIZER.md](SYNTHESIZER.md), following [EPISTEMICS.md](EPISTEMICS.md). You own every investigator's output: open each citation the answer leans on (the PR, the ticket, the thread) before you cite it, and never propagate a citation you did not check. Never cite code as evidence for its own intent.

## 6. Present

Keep the confidence language intact, including in any one-line summary you add in chat: an Inferred claim stays hedged. When the question precedes a change to this code, end with the Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk block from SYNTHESIZER.md.

**Recency bias** is the common failure. The most recent commit is rarely authoritative: the current shape is often the accretion of many earlier decisions. Trace back.

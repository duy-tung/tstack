# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets**: tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it and the checks that prove it.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/tstack:setup` before you publish.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

If the whole change fits in one fresh context window, say so and suggest `/tstack:implement` instead of tickets.

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests): vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges**: the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

Order the tickets so each lands green before the next starts and the sequence proves itself to a reviewer: prefactoring and subtraction before reshaping, scaffold and baseline capture before the feature.

**Acceptance criteria fail at the starting commit.** For each criterion, name the observation that would show it false, and confirm it is false at the commit the implementer starts from. Rewrite any criterion that is already true there, that only another ticket's work can satisfy, or that restates the request instead of an observable result. A prefactoring ticket's criteria are structural facts that are false now (a deep import that exists, a lint rule that fails), plus existing behavior still passing.

**Every ticket carries a `Verify:` line** with two checks:

- **Unit**: the test or check, named by behaviour, that is red at the starting commit and green when done.
- **Live**: the feature of the repo's verify skill (`.claude/skills/verify-<app>/`) to drive and the result to observe. Without a verify skill, the command and its expected output.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand-contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket; green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, the thing you can demo when it lands
- **Verify**: the unit and live checks

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct: does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the tickets to the configured tracker

Publish the approved tickets. **How** depends on the tracker the repo's issue-tracker doc describes; the tickets are the same either way, only the shape of the blocking edges changes:

- **Local files** → write one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order (blockers first). Each file's "Blocked by" lists the numbers/titles it depends on. Use the per-ticket file template below: one ticket per file, never a single combined file.
- **GitHub** → create one issue per ticket in dependency order (blockers first, so their numbers exist at creation) with native links: `gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file <body.md> --parent <spec-number> --blocked-by <n>,<n>` (`--parent` only when the source is an existing issue; add `--label <ready-for-agent label>` only when `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` exists). If `gh issue create --help` lacks `--parent` or `--blocked-by` (older gh), make those links with the tracker doc's API calls; if that fails too, the `## Parent` section and a `## Blocked by` section carry the edges.
- **Another real issue tracker (GitLab, Linear, …)** → publish one issue per ticket in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's blocking edges can reference real identifiers. Use the platform's native blocking / sub-issue relationship where it has one; otherwise write each ticket's `## Blocked by` section. Apply the `ready-for-agent` label from `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` when that file exists, unless instructed otherwise; the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. For a purely linear chain that means top to bottom.

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue. Linking a ticket to it as a sub-issue is fine.

When the tickets are published, tell the user how to run them: `/tstack:implement <ticket>` in a fresh session per ticket, or `/tstack:afk` to work the frontier unattended.

<local-ticket-template>

# <NN>: <Ticket title>

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective, not a layer-by-layer implementation list.

**Blocked by:** the numbers/titles of the tickets that gate this one, or "None (can start immediately)".

**Triage:** ready-for-agent

**Status:** open

- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2

**Verify:**
- Unit: <the test or check that is red now and green when done>
- Live: <the verify-<app> feature to drive and the result to observe, or the command and its expected output>

</local-ticket-template>

<issue-template>

## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the tracker (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Verify:**
- Unit: <the test or check that is red now and green when done>
- Live: <the verify-<app> feature to drive and the result to observe, or the command and its expected output>

## Blocked by

Only when the tracker cannot hold a native blocking link: a reference to each blocking ticket, or "None (can start immediately)".

</issue-template>

In either form, avoid specific file paths or code snippets: they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.

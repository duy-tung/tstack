# Decision log

Keep one canonical log.

## The format

A single TSV file, one row per decision. Cells stay single-line. Evidence is a pointer, not prose. [template.tsv](template.tsv) is the header row; `log.sh` writes it on first use. Columns:

- **ts.** ISO8601 timestamp, UTC.
- **phase.** The phase or workstream.
- **decision.** What was chosen or done, one line.
- **why.** The reason in plain words. If a principle drove it, say it plainly, not as a jargon tag.
- **evidence.** A link or path that proves it: commit SHA, PR number, `file:line`, or an artifact, trace, or screenshot path. Never a paragraph.
- **result.** The outcome or predicate state: `tests green`, `reverted`, `pixel-diff 0`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `open`.

An example, plain-spoken so a reviewer reads it at a glance:

```
ts	phase	decision	why	evidence	result
2026-05-24T09:02:00Z	frame	counted the work first, about 100 components and roughly 75 hours	wanted to know the size before starting a long run	commit 3a9f1c2	found 5 things to sort out before starting
2026-05-24T09:40:00Z	harness	took screenshots of the old version before changing anything	so we can compare old against new and catch any visual change	scripts/snapshot.sh, baseline/	saved 120 reference screenshots
2026-05-24T11:15:00Z	widget	moved the widget styles over without changing how it looks	keep the change small and the result identical	commit 7c21e0a, pixel-diff 0	looks identical, tests pass
2026-05-24T12:30:00Z	widget	threw out a helper's work because its screenshots were blank	checked the real files instead of trusting its summary	worktree reset	reverted, tightened the instructions for next time
```

## Logging a row

Write each entry the way you'd tell a teammate what you did: plain words, concrete actions, no AI speak or abstract jargon. The `tstack:unslop` rules apply to log text too.

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log.sh" <logfile> <phase> <decision> <why> <evidence> <result>
```

It stamps `ts`, writes the header on first use, turns stray tabs and newlines into spaces, and prefixes any cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` with a single quote, so a PR title or filename never runs as a spreadsheet formula. A bare `printf` appending a row works too, but mind those same bytes when cells come from generated or user-supplied text.

Log decision points and checkpoints, not every action: a fork chosen, a unit completed with its verification result, a pivot or revert with its trigger, a blocker surfaced, a gate fixed. For loop runs, one row per iteration. Skip the trivial and self-evident.

## Runs and the start row

A run is one agent conversation, including its later turns and any compaction summary of it. A pickup in a new session, a replacement agent, or a new chat starts a new run.

When a run adds to a log that already has rows, its first row has phase `start`, and so does its first row after another run's `start` row. So a run that comes back to a log in a later turn first reads the log's last rows to see whether another run wrote since. A `start` row names the `ts` range of the rows before it that this run did not write, and its evidence names this run: `session ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`. Use phase `start` for nothing else.

## Where it lives

`.tstack/<slug>/decisions.tsv`, where `<slug>` names the task (the same directory as an unattended run's `contract.md` and `ledger.tsv`). `/tstack:setup` gitignores `.tstack/`, so the log is a working artifact by default.

Commit it only when the work is ambitious enough that a reviewer needs the trail to trust the result (`git add -f .tstack/<slug>/decisions.tsv`).

## Rules

- Append-only. A wrong call gets a new row that supersedes it. Never edit or delete history.
- Prefer evidence produced by committed scripts over hand-made one-offs (P9, build the lever, in `tstack:principles`).

## Audit the log against the transcript

At the end of the run, before handing back, check that the log told the truth. This run's transcript is `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.jsonl`, where `<encoded-cwd>` is the directory the session started in with every character other than a letter or digit replaced by `-` (`/home/me/app` becomes `-home-me-app`). If that path does not exist, run `ls -t ~/.claude/projects/*/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.jsonl` and take the newest match. Read only that file. Other transcripts are unrelated private chats.

Walk this run's rows against what actually happened. Each stretch of them begins at one of this run's `start` rows, or at the first row if this run created the log, and ends at the next `start` row of another run:

- Check that every row maps to a real decision or action.
- Check that each row's evidence resolves and shows what the row claims.
- A fork, pivot, or abandoned approach that shaped the work but isn't logged is a gap. Add it.

Correct the log, not the story. The audit never edits or removes a row, even an invented one. When a row records neither a real decision nor a real action, or its claim or evidence is wrong, add a row that supersedes it with what actually happened and a pointer that resolves. This audit does not check rows outside this run's stretches. If this run's own work shows one of them is wrong, supersede it like any wrong call.

## Second-seat review of the trail

Before handing back, a reviewer that did not do the work reads the trail and the run's transcript, then flags what the user should pay attention to. Self-review is not a substitute. Not a redo of the work: a scan for what's suboptimal or risky.

Pick the seat:

1. **A fresh `general-purpose` subagent** (the default). It shares your model family, so its blind spots are correlated with yours. Say so in the Attention line.
2. **An external CLI**, only when allowed: the user asked for an external seat in this task, or the repo's AGENTS.md or CODING_STANDARDS.md allows external reviewers. It sends the transcript to another vendor, so never choose it on your own. When allowed and installed (`command -v codex`, `command -v gemini`), copy only this run's transcript and log into a new temp directory and point the brief there: `codex exec --sandbox read-only "<brief>"`, or `gemini -p "<brief>" --include-directories "<that temp dir>"`. A different model family has different blind spots.

The brief gives the log path and the transcript path (pointers, not pasted content), the four flag types below, and the reply format: one flag per line, each pointing at a row's `ts` or a moment in the transcript, or "No flags". It ends with: "Read only. Do not edit files. Do not invoke tstack skills or spawn agents."

The reviewer flags:

- Decisions logged with weak or absent evidence.
- Verification steps skipped, or claimed without proof in the transcript.
- Choices that look risky in hindsight: premature, scope-creeping, papering over a symptom.
- Gaps the user would otherwise miss on a casual skim.

## Attention

Every reply for a run that produced a trail ends with an Attention section. The first line names the seat. Then list each flag, pointing to specific rows or moments:

```
## Attention
reviewed by a fresh general-purpose subagent (same model family, blind spots correlated)
- 11:15:00Z widget: "tests pass" has no test output in the evidence column.
```

An external seat reads `reviewed by codex exec (external CLI)`. "No flags" is a valid value. The seat line is not optional.

## Reviewing the trail

Read top to bottom, follow the evidence pointers, spot-check. GitHub renders a committed TSV as a table. `column -s$'\t' -t .tstack/<slug>/decisions.tsv` renders it in a terminal.

## Composing this skill

Other skills route their audit trail here instead of inventing one. Reference it by name (`tstack:decision-log`) and let it own the format. Don't restate the columns.

# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is a `Triage:` line near the top of each issue file, using the role strings in `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` when it exists, else the role names themselves (`needs-triage`, `ready-for-agent`, and so on). A `Category:` line holds `bug` or `enhancement`.
- Work state is a `Status:` line: `open` (the default when the line is absent), `claimed` or `resolved`
- Blocking edges are a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top of the issue file. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists has `Status: resolved`
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading
- **Close**: append what landed under `## Comments`, then set `Status: resolved`

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/tstack:wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket. Blocking, frontier and claim apply to any ticket set, including tickets from `/tstack:to-tickets`.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
